# PKSG Pipelines
- The main idea of PKSG is briefly explained here: https://github.com/LeSaRDe/pksg/blob/main/pksg_demo.pptx
- The efficacy of phrases is justified by SemEval2020t1. 
- Extracting phrases from the argument structures induced by Semantic Role Labeling can be a good alternative to the semantic-unit-based phrase extraction. Some test code has been included. Official code will be available soon.
